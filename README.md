# Ashinaga

A monorepo containing all deployable applications and shared code for the Ashinaga project.

## About Ashinaga

Ashinaga is an international foundation providing educational and emotional support to orphaned students from 49 countries in sub-Saharan Africa who have lost one or both parents. The foundation helps these students access higher education and develop leadership skills to contribute to their communities.

## üìÅ Project Structure

This monorepo is organized into three main directories:

### `apps/` - Deployable Applications

### `packages/` - Shared Code

### `infra/` - Terraform code for the Ashinaga project

## Monorepo

This monorepo uses Turborepo and these tools are set up:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type-safety
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for code linting and formatting
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) & [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for testing
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for UI component development

### Apps and Packages

    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api                       # NestJS API server with PostgreSQL

Each package and application are 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) safe.

## üîÑ GitHub Workflows

A **Quality** workflow runs on every push to ensure code quality by running linting, tests, and builds across all packages. View results in the Actions tab or test locally with `pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build`.

### Commands

#### Build

```bash
# Will build all the app & packages with the supported `build` script.
pnpm run build

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è If you plan to only build apps individually,
# Please make sure you've built the packages first.
```

#### Develop

```bash
# Will run the development server for all the app & packages with the supported `dev` script.
pnpm run dev
```

#### test

```bash
# Will launch a test suites for all the app & packages with the supported `test` script.
pnpm run test

# You can launch e2e testes with `test:e2e`
pnpm run test:e2e

# Generate test coverage reports
pnpm run test:coverage

# Generate and open coverage reports
pnpm run test:coverage:open

# See `@workspace/jest-config` to customize the behavior.
```

#### Test Coverage

Test coverage reports are generated in the `coverage/` directory for each app:

- **API App Coverage**: [`apps/api/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`](apps/api/coverage/lcov-report/index.html)
- **Web App Coverage**: [`apps/web/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`](apps/web/coverage/lcov-report/index.html)

Run `pnpm test:coverage:open` to generate and automatically open coverage reports in your browser.

#### Lint

```bash
# Will lint all the app & packages with the supported `lint` script.
# See `@workspace/eslint-config` to customize the behavior.
pnpm run lint
```

#### Format

```bash
# Will format all the supported `.ts,.js,json,.tsx,.jsx` files using Biome.
pnpm format
```

#### Storybook

```bash
# Start Storybook development server for UI components
cd packages/ui && pnpm storybook

# Build Storybook for production
cd packages/ui && pnpm build-storybook
```
